# Software Developer

## About Me

Hello, I am Sam Perelgut, a software developer with a specialization in machine learning. I am a relatively recent graduate of the University of California, Irvine, where I obtained my M.S. in computer science. Prior to that, I attended the University of California, Davis, where I double majored in computer science and cognitive science. I am currently working in game development at a new start-up called NotHalfBadGames as a contract software developer. I am passionate about AI and its applications in a variety of fields. I believe it can be used to change the world, and I would like to be part of that change.
  
#### Technical Skills: Python, C/C++, Tensorflow/Keras, PyTorch, SQL, GDScript

### Heart Attack Detection Website
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/sperelgut/HeartAttackDetection) and [Report and Results](https://github.com/sperelgut/sperelgut.github.io/blob/main/assets/ProjectReport.pdf)

- Served as team leader and full stack developer for creation of a website which would classifier users as at risk or 
not for heart attack
- Performed data analysis, Front-end development, back-end development and integration of the two using 
PyTorch, React, and Flask
- Supervised Learning Classifier utilizing neural network over Big Data



### Sokoban Solver

- Developed an artificial intelligence program that uses Reinforcement Learning/Q-Learning
to solve Sokoban boards in Python.
- Utilized the A* algorithm and softlock detection to increase performance

### Seq2Seq Title Generation
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/sperelgut/CS272-Final-Project) and [Report and Results](https://github.com/sperelgut/sperelgut.github.io/blob/main/assets/CS272_Report-1.pdf)

- Developed a Natural Language Processing program using PyTorch to generate titles for forum posts.
- Used Seq2Seq models including RNN model, BART Transformer model, and BigBird-Pegasus Transformer 
model. 
- Utilized attention model and word embeddings to build decoder, evaluated using BLEU

### Ensemble Classifier 
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/sperelgut/Fashion-Classifier)

- Developed an Ensemble classifier using Scikit-learn to classify images in the Fashion-MNIST dataset
- Utilized Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine, Random Forrest and Convolutional Neural Network
to build an Ensemble classifier
